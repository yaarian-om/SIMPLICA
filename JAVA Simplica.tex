\part{Introduction}
JAVA is a Programming language which is used mostly in offial softwares because of it's strong security system.
It is a high-level language which uses JVM to convert the high-level code to a machine code.
It is one of the most popular programming languages out there. Released in 1995 and still widely used today.
Java has many applications, including software development, mobile applications, and large systems development.
Knowing Java opens a lot of possibilities for us as a developer.

\chapter*{Preface}
JAVA knowledge is vast. People most often have to go through most of the documentations of the code then they could think of writing something.
Moreover, sometimes people looses their interest in learning JAVA or write their codes in JAVA. So in that case they just give online posts
and hire outsourcers to complete there school/college projects howmeworks and others.
This processs is both insecure and costly. In this book I just tried to teach JAVA  in a simple way and by which
people can start doing their school/college projects howmeworks and others by their own having simple knowledge. Thus, they can learn the vast knowledge slowly and more interesting way.

\chapter{History of JAVA}
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems and released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license.
Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers
and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.
